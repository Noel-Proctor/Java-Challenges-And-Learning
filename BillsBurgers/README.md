This is a basic console application for a fictional fast food company called bills burgers. The application enables to user to place an order at the restaurant by entering an interger corresponding to an option on screen.

Purpose:
The purpose of this application was to allow me to refresh my OOP knowledge after some time away from Java. 

Functionality:

1. The user can first choose wether the meal to sit in or take away:

2. The user can then select from a range of order options:

3. If the user selects a meal deal, they will then be prompted to select a main, side, and a drink of choice. Once the selection has been made
   the user will be shown their current order and asked if they want to add another item, complete their order, or cancel the order:

This was a very basic project for me to practice principles of OOP. I have decided to leave this mini project here to begin learning other topics/projects. I may come back to it in the future to continue development, I may not. 

Some future improvements:
- Add mappings to store a price for each item to calculate total cost.
- Add logic to generate an order number and order status once an order is placed.
- Add unit testing
- Improve class structure
- Add a database connection to populate meal/ item options rather than building in code.
- Add and connect a front end to improve user experience.
